# Elevator Simulator
- Simulator works for 5 elevators. Therefore, elevator class has elevator count constant parameter.
- Elevators have 6 person capacity and energy save mode that means when it required, it works, otherwise it does not work
- Each elevator has own door, floor indicator light, control panel that, includes target floor buttons, door open/close buttons and emergency button.
- Each floor has 5 elevator shafts
- Each floor has door, blinker that shows arriving floor and direction, elevator call button, and door ring bell
- Passenger can call the elevator and select the target floor
- Simulator log the usage data, create random passenger on random floor
- Programmer can charge an elevator and give a overload warning

Regarding these criterias, I designed below UML diagram:
